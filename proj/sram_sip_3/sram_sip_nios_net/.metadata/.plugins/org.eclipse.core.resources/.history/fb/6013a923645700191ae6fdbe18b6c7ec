/* 
 * Simple Socket Server (SSS) example. 
 * 
 * Please refer to the Altera Nichestack Tutorial documentation for details on this 
 * software example, as well as details on how to configure the TCP/IP 
 * networking stack and MicroC/OS-II Real-Time Operating System.  The Altera
 * Nichestack Tutorial, along with the rest of the Nios II documentation is published 
 * on the Altera web-site.  See: 
 * Start Menu -> Programs -> Nios II Development Kit -> Nios II Documentation.
 * In particular, chapter 9 of the Nios II Software Developer's Handbook 
 * describes Ethernet & Network stack.
 * 
 * Software Design Methodology Note:
 * 
 * The naming convention used in the Simple Socket Server Tutorial employs
 * capitalized software module references as prefixes to variables to identify
 * public resources for each software module, while lower-case 
 * variables with underscores indicate a private resource used strictly 
 * internally to a software module.
 * 
 * The software modules are named and have capitalized variable identifiers as
 * follows:
 * 
 * SSS      Simple Socket Server software module  
 * LED      Light Emitting Diode Management software module
 * NETUTILS Network Utilities software module
 * 
 * OS       Micrium MicroC/OS-II Real-Time Operating System software component
